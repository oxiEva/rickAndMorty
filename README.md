About this repository
==================
This repository contains the final exercise for the course QA & Testing from Hiberus University.

We are working with [Rick and MortyAPI](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) . Here's the [documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)
of this API.

What do I need to run?
---
A Java 8 JDK, Maven, Cucumber and Rest Assured. That's it!

ðŸ“® Postman
---
I have the collection in the folder Postman where there are the needed requests and its validations.

  Generation of tests in each call to verify that it has been executed correctly.
  ![Postman Run Collection](./src/test/resources/Pictures/postmanRunCollection.png)

  Then we run the collection on Newman and we have this report:
  ![Newman tests](./src/test/resources/Pictures/newmanTestsCollection.png)

  ![Newman report](./src/test/resources/Pictures/newmanResultsCollection.png)

âœ… How I run the tests?
---

All the tests:

    mvn test

Features tests:

    mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@jiraTicketName"
    mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@aut-1"


Character tests:

    mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@character"

Character tests:

    mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@episode"
   



ðŸ“„ Reporting
---

Also, I add this plugin [cucumber-reporting](https://github.com/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting?tab=readme-ov-file). With it, we can see pretty html reports with charts showing the results.
